# Bidding Analysis
## Overview
This project involves analyzing the bidding data for the sample course COR1305 for Term 1 Window 1 at SMU across three academic years: 2021-22, 2022-23, and 2023-24.
The goal of this analysis is to evaluate the median and minimum bid prices for different instructors and sections within these years using R. 

## Objectives
* Analyze the median and minimum bid prices for COR1305 across different years.
* Compare the bidding patterns for different instructors and sections.
* Provide visual insights through scatter plots 

## Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: R
Packages Used:
* ggplot2 for data visualization
* dplyr for data manipulation
* readxl for reading Excel files
* tidyr for data tidying

## Key Findings
* Median and Minimum Bid Prices: Identified trends and variations in median and minimum bid prices for COR1305 over the three years.
* Instructor and Section Analysis: Highlighted differences in bidding patterns across various or specific instructors and sections.
* Visual Insights: Created scatter plots and bar charts to visually represent the bidding data, making it easier to identify key trends and outliers.


## Visualizations
* Scatter Plots: Displayed the median and minimum bid prices for each instructor and section, with clear labels and color coding for easy differentiation.


## Conclusion
This analysis provided valuable insights into the bidding patterns for COR1305, helping to understand how bid prices vary by instructor and section over time. The visualizations created in this project make it easier to identify trends and make data-driven decisions for future bidding strategies.
